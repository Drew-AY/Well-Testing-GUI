# Well-Testing-GUI
Software for automating oil well test analysis. 

## Input
Temporal pressure test data is read into the program in csv format and reservoir data is typed into entry widgets.

## Process
Test data is searched to find the appropriate time region for analysis after which it is fitted to a linear equation. The slope of the resulting linear equation alongside the reservoir data is used to calculate important reservoir parameters like the permeability, skin and initial pressure. 

## Output 
The program returns the plot of the test data with a linear fit of the identified region of interest along with the desired reservoir parameters like permeability, skin  and initial pressure.

## Future Development 
I plan to improve and update this program as often as possible. The plan is to get a program which not only automates well testing analysis for oil wells but gas and unconventionals as well.
